@fixture-OroReportBundle:user_with_service_value_in_first_name.yml
Feature: Reports should not process services in filers
  In order to manage reports
  As administrator
  I should not be able to call service from Symfony service container using Custom Report

  Scenario: Create report with the service call as filter value
    Given I login as administrator
    When I go to Reports & Segments / Manage Custom Reports
    And I click "Create Report"
    And I fill "Report Form" with:
      | Name        | Test Users Report |
      | Entity      | User              |
      | Report Type | Table             |
    And I add the following columns:
      | First name |
      | Last name  |
    And I add the following filters:
      | Field Condition | First name | is equal to | @testService->doWork() |
    When I save and close form
    Then I should see following grid:
      | First name             | Last name  |
      | @testService->doWork() | Test       |
